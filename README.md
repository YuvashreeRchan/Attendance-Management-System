# ABSTRACT

Hello and welcome to our project on face recognition-based attendance system!

In this project, we aim to modernize the traditional attendance system used in educational institutions by utilizing digital tools like face recognition. With the traditional attendance system, teachers need to mark registers, which is time-consuming and prone to human errors. However, with our proposed system, the attendance can be recorded automatically by matching students' faces with the images stored in a dataset.

The system is designed to capture images of students in the classroom and match them with the images in the dataset. If the system recognizes a student's face, their attendance is marked, and a CSV file is produced, making it easier for teachers to keep track of attendance. The unrecognized faces are stored separately as Unknown Images in a different folder.

Our project uses various digital tools and technologies, including face detection and recognition algorithms, open-source libraries like OpenCV ,tkinter and programming languages like Python.

To use this system, you will need a camera or a webcam, a computer with Python installed, and the required libraries. We have provided detailed instructions in our code and README file on how to set up and use the system.

We hope that our project will make attendance recording easier, more efficient, and accurate for educational institutions.
